
Things I need to do for Tracker:

**Link to a webpage when computer is clicked
** Make sure button turns off when issue was addressed
Add some alert for closing procedures
** Strip our Commons dependence - make sure it can work with multiple departments
fix timestamping when a computer ticket is closed.
Display the issue a client is having
** Add  department and client question fields to the DB

Other things that have been done July 2008:

Client help screen turns red and flashes when active
When you click the to turn off the help button the caution image also stops




Nice to haves:

Integrate yacker into tracker
sort tracking issues by which one are used most
create a schema file for the xml
